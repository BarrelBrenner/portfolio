this is a simple about me page for week 2, was not comfortable with a pic so added a stand-in from a generator listed on site, you can dock grade for it if need be. Also Template is from nu-chi-virt-fsf-pt-03-2021-u-c --> 02-Advanced-CSS folder --> 01-Activities Folder --> 28-Stu_Mini-Project Folder --> Main Folder --> index.html.

I swapped colors around from original but interface is the same. Also added photos from following sources to fill in boxes
